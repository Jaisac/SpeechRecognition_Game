# SpeechRecognition_Game
First program attempt to use speech recognition in a game using certain open source packages.

This could be the template for more applications. Some issues noted are:

-It doesn't differentiate very well some words with similar sounding consonant like p,f, etc.This might be
a problem in pre-processing audio.

Possible improvements:
-Enhance the preprocessing audio routines for better understanding of some consonants.
-Make the speech recognition available to other languages (only in English in this version). Possible targat language could be Russian or Swedish.
